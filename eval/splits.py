"""Shared, dataset-stratified subject split manifest (REMEDIATION_PLAN Phase 1.1 — H7/H8).

**The problem this replaces.** Every model used to call `scoring.subject_disjoint_split(S, seed)`
on *its own* aggregate subject array. Two consequences, both measured:

  * **H8 — models disagreed on folds.** harnet excludes gravity-removed streams, which changes the
    subject universe *before* the shuffle, so **16.5% of the 363 shared subjects landed in a
    different train/val/test fold than HALO's.** The two models were therefore selected and
    calibrated on different data, which silently breaks the "same protocol" claim.
  * **H7 — the split was not stratified.** Shuffling the aggregate pool left **HHAR, MHEALTH and
    PAMAP2 with zero validation subjects**, and NFI-FARED with a single val subject carrying a
    single label. Epoch selection and temperature calibration were effectively blind to those
    datasets.

**The fix.** Split subjects **within each dataset**, once, deterministically, and cache the result.
Every model then *looks up* assignments instead of reshuffling — so folds are identical no matter
which streams a given model can consume. A model that must skip a stream simply contributes fewer
windows; it does not move anybody's subject.

Subject ids are ``"dataset:subject"``, matching what the adapters already build.

        stays None -> the adapters' ``if best_sd is not None`` guard keeps the LAST epoch, and
        Phase 1.3 then calibrates temperature on an empty tensor. Nothing raises anywhere.
