"""Loader for the new-repo grid format, feeding the ZS-XD evaluation.

Each dataset stores windowed grids under::

    data/datasets/<ds>/grids/{harmonised,non_harmonised}/<stream>/
        data.npy   float32 (N, T, C)   accelerometer (+gyro) in g
        mask.npy   bool    (C,)         per-channel validity (False = zero-pad)
        meta.json  {dataset, stream_id, alignment, rate_hz, channels[list],
                    labels[per-window list], subjects[per-window list]}

and a pre-registered candidate label vocabulary at
``data/datasets/<ds>/eval_labels.json`` (the ZS-XD target strings for that
dataset). Harmonized grid construction may store a genuine synonym under its training-corpus
canonical name; :func:`eval.scoring.align_ground_truth_labels` maps that internal representation
back to the unique frozen target string before scoring. The global ConSE training vocabulary lives at
``data/labels/global_labels.json``.

Unlike the legacy loader (which majority-voted raw per-timestep activity codes
through an ``idx_to_label`` map, with an offset bug), the grid meta already
carries a decoded per-window label string and subject id — so ground truth is
read directly, offset-free. Native (`non_harmonised`) is the default eval source
because baseline adapters resample per their own input contract; harmonised is
exposed via the `alignment` argument.

                     or resampled ``"harmonised"``.
        windows:     (N, T, C) float32 sensor windows (accel + optional gyro), in g.

                     the grid meta — NOT yet aligned or filtered to `eval_labels`).
        subjects:    (N,) subject ids, one per window.

        execution_ids: the leakage unit — one continuous physical capture. Derived by removing the

                     only; anything deciding what may be enrolled against what must use
                     ``execution_ids``.
        execution_granularity: ``"recording"`` when a ``recordings.json`` applied, else ``"block"``.

                     duplicate/implausible caches do not cover this alignment. Never silently empty.
