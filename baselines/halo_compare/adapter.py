"""HALO comparison model, scored on the shared adaptation manifest.

Two faces from one checkpoint, exactly as the design specifies:

* ``window_features`` — the encoder's pooled row per evaluation window, consumed by the shared
  nearest / prototype / ridge / linear-head readouts. Apples-to-apples with every baseline's
  frozen-feature row.
* **native enrollment** — the deployed mechanism. The manifest's support rows *are* the support
  set: they are already execution-disjoint from the query and drawn from the same stream, hence
  config-compatible by construction. There is **no corpus bank** at k >= 1; that stage was removed
  from the model, not hidden here.

THE ZERO-SHOT ROW
-----------------
At k = 0 there is no support, so the deployed mechanism has nothing to compare against. Per the
2026-09-03 decision the k = 0 row keeps the same mechanism and draws its support from the
*training* corpus: recordings that are config-compatible with the query and whose labels exclude
every candidate. The model still cannot find the answer among them; it can only note which
training recordings the query resembles and let their label text bridge to the candidates.

**It is an ensemble of small, training-shaped comparisons, not one large one** (revised 2026-09-04).
A single 64-row draw spanning many labels is off-distribution: the sampler trains on episodes of
2-8 candidate labels with K = 32, so a wide flat support set asks the comparator a question it has
never been asked. Instead the row is scored R times, each draw being a handful of seen labels with
their example recordings, shaped exactly like a training episode; the per-draw candidate scores are
then combined. Two things improve at once — the comparison matches the training distribution, and
averaging over draws removes the support draw as a nuisance variable. That variable is known to
matter here: on this codebase the *draw* once contributed five times the run-to-run scatter of the
thing being measured.

Ensembling is also the intervention with the best track record on this project: averaging eight
label paraphrases was the single largest Phase-B gain (45.3 -> 47.5 macro-F1), and it has no learned
parameters, which is the category of change that has historically survived its controls here.

Two evaluation streams have no compatible training partner at all (``upper_limb_use``, whose
wrist sensor is a research IMU rather than a watch, and ``usc_had/phone_hip``, which has near
misses only). For those the k = 0 row is reported as **unsupported**, with the reason recorded in
the artifact. It is not silently replaced by a different mechanism, and it is not padded with
incompatible rows.
