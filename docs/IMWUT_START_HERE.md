# START HERE — branch `imwut/compare`

You are on the branch for the **IMWUT comparison-model line**. If you read only one document before
touching anything, read this one. It exists because this repository has carried three successive
research lines and most of the confusion available here comes from mistaking one for another.

Last updated 2026-09-04.

## 1. Motivation — the problem, and why this is the response

### The problem the field has

Wearable activity recognition does not fail for lack of model capacity. It fails because **every
deployment is a different sensing problem**. Change the device, where it sits on the body, which
axes it reports, whether gravity is present, and the same activity produces a different signal.
Every 2025-26 survey of the area names this — heterogeneity across users, devices and placements —
as the dominant barrier to models that work outside the dataset they were fitted on.

The field's standard answer is to build a bigger, more invariant encoder: train on more sources,
augment away the nuisances, and hope one representation covers everything. We tried that here for
two years. It produces a representation that separates activities beautifully *within* a
configuration and transfers poorly *across* one.

### Why comparison, and not a better classifier

The measurement that redirected this project: our frozen features separate activities at **84.3
macro-F1** under a supervised linear probe, while zero-shot recognition through the label-text
bridge sits at **39.6** — a 44.7-point gap
([`RESULTS_V2.md`](results/classification/RESULTS_V2.md)). The encoder was never the bottleneck.
What was missing was a way to turn "this recording resembles that one" into an answer.

And when we gave the model exemplars to compare against, an **entirely untrained** retrieve-and-vote
rule reached **44.1** like-for-like — against 47.3 for a 4.2M-parameter model trained on roughly
700k person-days of wrist data, and against 42.7 for the ConSE bridge.

**Read that carefully, because it is easy to overclaim.** 44.1 does *not* beat harnet. An earlier
write-up quoted **47.5** for this mechanism and said it did; that figure carried two confounds and
its like-for-like value is 44.1 — the correction is recorded at the top of
[`EVIDENCE_ENGINE_FINDINGS.md`](results/classification/EVIDENCE_ENGINE_FINDINGS.md). What survives
is still the point worth building on: a mechanism with **no trained parameters at all** landed
within about three points of a model trained on four orders of magnitude more sensor data, and
above the standard open-vocabulary bridge. The comparison was doing real work before any learning
happened. That is a reason to invest in the comparison, not a claim to have won.

So the bet is: **stop asking for one representation of all human motion, and start asking a much
easier question.** Not "what activity is this?" but "which of these few labelled examples does this
resemble?" — with the examples chosen to be acquisition-compatible with the query, the way any real
deployment would choose them. That question is well-posed under heterogeneity in a way the first
one is not, because the query and its examples share a sensing configuration by construction.

### Thesis

**Recognise by comparison, not classification.** Given a query recording and a handful of labelled
example recordings acquired under a compatible sensor configuration, a small comparator decides
which examples the query resembles and reads the answer off their labels in language space.

The model is *not* asked to learn a universal representation of all IMU data. It is asked to embed
motion well enough that attention over a compatible support set can make the call.

### Why it should be publishable

Two capabilities fall out of the design rather than being bolted on. Labels are read through
language and no parameter is tied to a candidate, so **an unseen activity name is scored by the same
operation as a seen one** — **49 of the 64 candidate labels** in the `adaptation_v2` roster are
never seen in training. And a user
enrolling a few examples on their own device is the *native* mode of the model, not a fine-tuning
afterthought, which is the deployment story a ubicomp venue actually cares about.

**What we claim as novel: the training curriculum** — how support sets are sampled. Nothing in the
architecture is claimed as new; the comparator is a matching network with a language readout, and
the related-work section says so.

**Target venue: IMWUT. Deadline: 1 November 2026.** Double-blind, 8–10k words, and a
major-revision-then-accept path is the norm rather than a failure. The venue read is in
[`docs/research/IMWUT_VENUE_READ.md`](research/IMWUT_VENUE_READ.md).

Why this line at all: the supervisor ruled out a clinical pivot on 2026-09-03 (clinical venues want
one condition with data gathered for it, not a generic method that touches several), and HALO began
as an ML paper. The evidence that shaped the design is a ledger of measured failures from the
earlier lines — summarised in §7.

---

## 2. Design philosophy — read this before you "fix" anything

The design is the product of a long run of *negative* results (§7). Almost everything clever that
was tried here made things worse, and the things that worked were subtractions. That history is why
the code looks the way it does, and it is the single most important thing to understand before
changing it.

**Five principles, in priority order.**

1. **Simplicity is a claim, not laziness.** A fixed filterbank rather than a learned front end, no
   retrieval stage, no per-candidate parameters, one shared scalar head. Each of those is a
   position we defend in the paper, and each was reached by *deleting* something that had been
   measured and found not to pay. Adding machinery back needs evidence, not intuition.
2. **The mechanism must be one mechanism.** The same comparison rule runs at every point on the
   k-curve, k = 0 included. A model that quietly switches to a different rule when the support set
   is empty has two mechanisms and one misleading graph.
3. **Deployment realism beats benchmark convenience.** The compatibility filter exists because no
   real product would compare a pocket-phone query against smartwatch examples. We claim no novelty
   for it — it is a considered constraint, not a contribution, and it is applied at support
   construction rather than learned.
4. **Honesty over impressiveness.** An unmeasurable cell is reported unmeasurable. A gap inside the
   noise floor is reported as "we do not know". A dataset that cannot answer a question is
   documented as such rather than coerced into a number.
5. **Controls before claims.** Every learned component is guilty until its control clears it,
   because on this codebase the majority of learned components have been net-negative on first
   measurement. The untrained floor and the paired step-0 control are not paperwork; they are the
   only reason we can tell learning from luck.

### Choices that look like bugs and are not

If you are sweeping this code for defects, these will all look wrong. They are deliberate. Each one
has a measurement or an argument behind it; changing any of them is a design decision for the user,
not a fix.

| Looks like a bug | Why it is there |
|---|---|
| **No retrieval stage.** The comparator attends over the whole support set with no top-k. | Retrieval was measured to rank by *acquisition configuration* rather than activity (×7.0 lift), and a learned retrieval stage was worth exactly +0.0000 paired. K is small enough to attend over completely. |
| **Labels are used verbatim** — no canonicalisation, no synonym merging, no dedup. Two candidates can carry near-identical text. | The readout gives them near-identical votes, which is the correct answer. Deduplicating would impose a closed vocabulary on an open-vocabulary model. |
| **Some k = 0 cells report "unsupported"** rather than a number. | Those streams have no config-compatible training partner, so the deployed mechanism genuinely does not apply. Substituting ConSE or padding with incompatible rows would report a different mechanism under this model's name. Principle 4. |
| **Support sets shrink below K instead of being padded.** | Padding with foreign rows would silently violate the compatibility rule; skipping the episode would bias the corpus toward well-populated configurations. Shrinking is logged in telemetry. |
| **Training starts from random init**, not from the Phase-A checkpoint that exists. | Every compact checkpoint that ever led the table was trained this way. An earlier draft of the docs claimed warm start was mandatory; that claim was wrong and is corrected. |
| **Encoder effective rank falls early in training.** | Measured before, on a 6k schedule where the apparent peak was head saturation. At 35k the same recipe produced the project's best result. It is logged as a watchdog, not treated as a failure. |
| **The residual head is zero-initialised**, so the model does nothing at step 0. | That is what makes step 0 *exactly* the closed-form vote, which is what the untrained floor and every paired comparison are defined against. It is asserted to 1e-6. Do not "helpfully" initialise it. |
| **Absent channels are exact zeros with a mask**, never imputed. | Fabricating a channel would hand the model information no deployment has. Principle 4. |
| **`adaptation_v1` still exists** alongside v2. | Kept for comparability with pre-pivot numbers. Different protocol names stop the assembler mixing rows. |
| **Retired baseline adapters (`halo`, `halo_compact`, `halo_evidence`) are still registered.** | They reproduce the frozen classification results. They are retired from the *table*, not from the repo. |
| **`hapt` raises if requested for evaluation.** | Same 30 subjects as `uci_har`, which is in training. This is a leak guard, not an oversight. |

### Known defect NOT to confuse with the above

`baselines/halo_compact/adapter.py` passes `stream.mask` straight into `encode_dataset_detailed`,
which requires the canonical 6-slot layout. It fails on accelerometer-only streams — `monipar`'s
native alignment in particular. This is a *real* bug. It was fixed in `halo_compare` via the
`_six_slot` helper and deliberately left alone in `halo_compact`, which is being retired. Fix it
there only if that adapter is needed again.

## 3. Which code is live, and which is a previous life

| Line | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **IMWUT comparison** (this branch) | **LIVE — this is the work** | `data/scripts/curate/compatibility.py`, `model/evidence/comparator.py`, `training/compare/`, `baselines/halo_compare/`, `eval/compare_cost.py`, `eval/enrollment_protocol.py` |
| Classification / evidence-engine | **superseded**, kept because it still produces the baseline table and the frozen results | `model/evidence/{engine,evidence_reranker,patch_retrieval,relational_decoder,confidence}.py`, `training/evidence/`, `training/tokenizer/`, `baselines/{halo,halo_compact,halo_evidence}/` |
| Application / motion-monitoring (Tasks 1–3) | **not the paper target**, but actively maintained by another agent on `main` | `applications/motion_monitoring/`, `docs/tasks/` |

**Do not delete the superseded code.** The classification stack still encodes evaluation streams,
still fits the ConSE bridge for closed-vocabulary baselines, and still reproduces the numbers quoted
in `docs/results/classification/`. It is superseded as a *design*, not as infrastructure.

**Do not touch `applications/`** unless asked. Another agent works there concurrently; unexpected
edits in this repository are usually that agent, not corruption.

**`docs/results/classification/` is frozen.** It is the provenance trail for numbers the paper
cites. Never edit those files; add new results elsewhere.

---

## 4. The model, end to end

1. **Draw an episode** (`training/compare/sampling.py`). Pick a query recording; look up its
   acquisition key; build the admissible pool — same key, different subject, different execution.
   With probability `p` the query's own label is among the candidates (few-shot); otherwise it is
   excluded (zero-shot). Pick 2–8 candidate labels verbatim, then fill K = 32 support recordings
   round-robin so labels are balanced to within one.
2. **Encode** the query and all support recordings together in one forward pass. Support is encoded
   **per query, with gradients** — nothing is cached, so the comparison itself trains the encoder.
3. **Centre** each episode on its own mean feature (default), so only how rows *differ* can drive
   anything downstream.
4. **Compare** (`model/evidence/comparator.py`). One set-attention sequence per query over
   `[candidates | query row | support rows + descriptors + labels]`. No retrieval, no top-k.
5. **Vote.** `score(c) = Σ_e weight(query, e, c) × vote(e, c)`, where an enrolled row votes 1 for
   its own candidate and any other row votes the rectified cosine between its label text and the
   candidate's. **No per-candidate parameters anywhere**, so an unseen candidate is scored by the
   same operation as a seen one.
6. **Loss.** Few-shot episodes get cross-entropy; zero-shot episodes get KL against the label-text
   similarity distribution at `tau_text = 0.1`, because with the answer absent a one-hot target is
   undefined.

At evaluation, k ≥ 1 uses the manifest's own enrolled support rows with **no corpus bank**. k = 0
is an **ensemble of 8 training-shaped draws** (4 seen labels × 8 recordings = K 32) with every
candidate label excluded, combined before the argmax.

The full design of record, including every ablation, is
[`docs/design/IMWUT_COMPARE_DESIGN.md`](design/IMWUT_COMPARE_DESIGN.md). **When this file and that
one disagree, that one wins** — it is the design of record and this is the orientation.

---

## 5. Standing conventions — violate these and the work is worthless

These are project rules, not preferences. Several exist because they were violated before and cost
a result.

1. **Never launch a training, control, or evaluation run without the user's explicit go.**
   "Implement" means build + tests + a short smoke on real data. Nothing longer.
2. **Two data roles only: training and evaluation. There is no development split.** Every constant,
   threshold and checkpoint choice is fixed *a priori*, by judgement, before the run. Never select a
   checkpoint or tune a hyper-parameter on evaluation data.
3. **Paired-gain rule.** Report a run as `score(trained) − score(its own step 0)`. The validation
   draw once contributed five times the run-to-run scatter of the thing being measured, so a raw
   number carries the draw, not the method. **Paired gain is only valid when both arms share the
   same step-0 function** — an architecture change (centering, front end) moves step 0, so those
   arms are compared by raw score at matched seeds instead.
4. **Every learned component is guilty until a control clears it.** Minimum: the untrained floor and
   the paired step-0 control; add a scrambled-vocabulary control wherever the language channel is
   involved. On this codebase almost every learned addition has been net-negative at first pass.
5. **Never fabricate a data channel.** Absent channels are exact zeros with a validity mask, never
   imputed, never randomly filled.
6. **"Unsupported" is a result.** When a dataset cannot answer a test, report that. Do not widen a
   relation or substitute a different mechanism to manufacture a number.
7. **The interpreter is `/home/alex/code/HALO/legacy_code/.venv/bin/python`**, run from the repo
   root. There is no venv in this repository.
8. **Another agent edits this repo concurrently.** Check `git status` before staging; never
   `checkout`/`reset` over someone else's work.
9. **Do not commit or push unless asked.**
10. **The GPU is shared and has 24 GB.** Estimate cost before proposing a run, and emit progress.

## 6. Datasets: what trains, what evaluates, and why

**Training — 18 datasets, 56 streams, 31 acquisition configs, 166 labels.**
`deployment_policy.EXPANDED_PHASE_A_TRAIN_DATASETS`.

**Evaluation — 10 datasets, manifest `adaptation_v2`** (70 cells, 48 usable, fingerprint
`0f98ae25…`). `adaptation_v1` (7 datasets) is kept intact for comparability but is **not** the
current protocol; the two carry different protocol names so the assembler cannot mix their rows.

- **49 of the 64 candidate labels** in the `adaptation_v2` roster are **never seen in training** —
  that is the open-vocabulary story. (An earlier note said 44 of 55; that counted the 7-dataset
  roster's observed grid labels rather than v2's pre-registered candidate vocabulary.)
- 4 of the 8 original evaluation acquisition configs are **unseen in training** — that is the
  heterogeneity story.
- `motionsense`, `realworld` and `shoaib` were restored on 2026-09-04. They were never unsuitable;
  they were the old *development* split, and that split no longer exists. They fix a confound —
  previously 8 of 11 streams were wrist and the hardest labels sat on exactly the streams with the
  narrowest support pools. **Disclose in the paper** that design decisions in the superseded
  Phase-B line were made while looking at them: no model was trained on them, so this is researcher
  exposure, not data leakage, and the a-priori-constants rule closes the channel by which it would
  otherwise inflate results.
- **`hapt` may never be evaluated.** It is the same 30 subjects as `uci_har`, which is in training.
  `build_manifest` raises if it is requested.
- `upper_limb_use` (4 streams) and `motionsense` have no config-compatible training stream, so their
  **k = 0 row is unsupported**. Their k ≥ 1 rows are unaffected. This is reported, not patched.

## 7. The evidence this design rests on

Every one of these is a measurement from the earlier lines, recorded in
`docs/results/classification/`. They are why the design looks like it does.

| Measurement | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Frozen features separate activities at 84 macro-F1; zero-shot through text sits near 40 | The encoder was never the bottleneck — the bridge was |
| Untrained retrieve-and-vote scored **44.1 like-for-like** (harnet 47.3, ConSE 42.7). The widely-quoted 47.5 was confounded — see §1 | Comparison against exemplars does real work *before* any training, but it did **not** beat harnet. Do not repeat the 47.5 claim |
| Retrieval ranked by **acquisition configuration**, ×7.0 lift, not by activity | Delete the retrieval stage; and centre the episode, since configuration is a common mode |
| Learned retrieval was worth **+0.0000** paired | The stage is not worth its complexity |
| The attention mixer gained +0.12, and a scrambled-vocabulary control inverted it | The gain is *semantic*; keep language in the loop |
| Closed-vocabulary episodic CE pushed zero-shot **below chance** (16.18 → 9.44) | Zero-shot episodes need a soft text target, not one-hot |
| Every compact checkpoint that ever led the table was trained **from random init** | End-to-end from scratch is the default; warm start is a secondary arm |
| Signal-similarity vs label-name-similarity: r ≈ 0.11 | Zero-shot is structurally capped; headline on k ≥ 1 and disclose k = 0 |

---

## 8. Decided and closed

- Arm A (core) sees **no acquisition text at any stage**; Arm B (experiment) has text ON with
  unfiltered support. Separate pretrains per arm; the trainer refuses a mismatched checkpoint.
- Compatibility is **binary**: `are_compatible` (identical key) and `is_near_miss` (same device
  family, equivalent site). There is deliberately **no graded distance ladder**.
- Sampling rate is **not** part of the acquisition key — the filterbank is rate-invariant by
  construction, so rate is nuisance within a configuration.
- Laterality is preserved but wording is not: `"the left wrist"` and `"left wrist"` are one site,
  while left and right wrist are a near miss. Non-dominant, affected and unaffected wrists are their
  own sites.
- Constants, fixed a priori: `K = 32`, `p = 0.5`, label subset 2–8, 35k steps, final-step
  checkpoint, ≥ 3 seeds; zero-shot ensemble R = 8 draws × 4 labels × 8 rows, combiner
  `probability`.
- Centering is **ON by default**; `--no-center-features` is the ablation.
- Fixed filterbank is the design of record; the continuous kernel is the challenger, not the
  default.

## 9. Still open

- **No training run has been launched.** Nothing here has evidence of beating its untrained floor.
- The GPU budget across nine queued ablation arms does not fit the schedule; the cut has not been
  made.
- The clean baseline rerun on `adaptation_v2` has not happened.
- Baseline weight audit for the 2025–26 comparators (Wonderwall, IMUZero, LanHAR, GOAT, MOMENT).
- Whether to spend GPU settling fixed-vs-continuous, or report it open.
