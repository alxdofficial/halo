"""Pipeline A Phase-1 data pipeline (pretraining corpus + sampler + collate).

Design decisions carried in from the gates:
  * Corpus = the expanded 18-dataset TRAIN recipe's **native** grids by default (eval sets never
    touched); the original 12-dataset matched recipe remains an explicit comparison arm. Native sampling
    RATE (no 60 Hz resample) + canonical labels + 6-ch pad+mask. The filterbank tokenizer is
    rate-invariant, so HALO trains on the corpus's REAL native rates (20/50/100 Hz) instead of a
    homogenized 60 Hz base — the 60 Hz "harmonised" grids are the layout-locked baselines' crutch,
    not HALO's. Source-balanced sampling (no per-stream cap) spreads each activity across configs.
  * Subject-disjoint train/val split per dataset.
  * Label-free hierarchical temperature sampling is the sole Phase-A sampler.
  * The reference augmentation is one independent SO(3) rotation per positive view. More aggressive
    signal, sensor, rate, crop, and text transforms remain explicit ablations.
  * Fixed one-second patches by default. Native sampling RATE still varies per sample and true patch
    lengths vary for final partial contexts; the filterbank consumes both explicitly.
  * Channel role and sensor identity/config come from deployment-policy text. Text augmentation is
    disabled in the reference recipe; absent channels carry a channel_mask and never fake text
    confidence.
