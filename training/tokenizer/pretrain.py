"""Pipeline A pretraining with two universal, label-free objectives.

  * JEPA: a masked student predicts a clean EMA teacher's contextual tokens.
  * VICReg: invariance, variance, and covariance regularization over two independently
    augmented views of every window.

Labels are used only by the validation probes. The corpus sampler is hierarchical and label-free:
capped dataset-temperature mass, subject-temperature mass, then windows.

Other invariants:
  * Config conditioning is channel TEXT; the text-dropout/paraphrase augs supply the
    "unseen description" robustness.                        (M2 lesson 2, upgraded by M3)
  * Gravity alignment is disabled by default; signed DC preserves posture while SO(3)
    augmentation supplies orientation robustness.           (2026-07-19 decision)
  * The encoder's inner filterbank norm is CALIBRATED before training.  (M3 lesson)

Model selection: subject-disjoint val kNN recall macro-averaged over label/stream cells, not loss.
Checkpoints carry config + label map + filterbank norm stats + provenance.

    must be shuffle=False / pre-shuffled). Guarantees every label is represented so the kNN metric
    covers all classes and best.pt selection is stable.

    Two things the earlier version got wrong, both measured on the live split:

    * The cap was evaluated for a whole batch BEFORE ``counts`` was updated, so a label sitting at
      39/40 admitted every one of its occurrences in that batch. Realised counts ran 3-79 per label
      on val and 27-89 on the train support, i.e. the kNN support bank was never balanced and the
      ConSE ridge fit was weighted toward over-represented labels. ``pending`` now closes the gap
      inside the batch, so the cap is exact.
    * The early exit required every target label to REACH ``per_label``. Labels with fewer than
      ``per_label`` windows in total can never reach it, so the loop always drained the whole
      loader — 186k val + 1.5M train rows per evaluation. ``label_totals`` (the label histogram of
      the keys backing this loader) makes the target ``min(per_label, total)``, which is reachable.
