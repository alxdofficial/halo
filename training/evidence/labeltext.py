"""Shared label-text tooling for the evidence engine — the single source of truth for
paraphrase ensembling and (optional) fine-grained descriptions.

Used by the T2.0 retrieval adapter (`baselines/halo_evidence`), the tier-1 sweep, and the
decoder trainer, so every code path anchors labels in the *same* SBERT text the way the
47.5 untrained mechanism did (raw canonical name + template/synonym paraphrases averaged).

- ``global_label_paraphrases`` merges every per-dataset synonym/template table into one
  dataset-agnostic pool. This is load-bearing: ``augment_label(label, dataset_name="")``
  falls into a generic fallback that ignores the synonym tables, so the global vocab labels
  (owned by no single dataset) would otherwise collapse to near-duplicate template wraps.
- ``ensemble_text`` returns the (L, 384) L2-normalized mean SBERT anchor per label. Variant
  0 is always the canonical name (so E=1 reproduces the plain-ConSE text); higher E adds
  paraphrase variants; a fine-grained **description** (T2.1), when present, is appended as an
  extra anchor. The description file is optional — absent ⇒ this is a no-op and the mechanism
  reproduces the exact 47.5 tier-1 config.
