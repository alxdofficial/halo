"""Convert MM-Fit (Stromback, Huang & Radu, IMWUT 2020) to the HALO session format.

Source: mmfit.github.io, `mm-fit/w{00..20}/` — 21 full workouts, each recorded simultaneously on
**four inertial devices** plus video/pose (not read here):

    sw_l   smartwatch, left wrist       sp_r   smartphone, right trouser pocket
    sw_r   smartwatch, right wrist      eb_l   earbud, left ear

Why this dataset is here: it is the corpus's cleanest **cross-configuration** source. The same
repetition of the same exercise is captured on a watch, a phone in a pocket and an earbud at once,
so a support example enrolled on one device and a query drawn from another is a genuine
change-of-configuration pair rather than a synthetic augmentation.

Each `.npy` is (N, 5) = `[frame, unix_timestamp_ms, x, y, z]`. Measured over all 21 workouts:
acceleration is **m/s^2 with gravity present** (median |a| 9.82-10.07) and angular rate is **rad/s**
(p99.9 of 4-8). The four devices log at genuinely different mean rates — 103 Hz and 104 Hz for the
watches, 212 Hz for the phone, 85 Hz for the earbud, and none of them uniformly — so they are
resampled onto ONE uniform grid from their shared wall clock. That is what makes the four streams
simultaneous sample-for-sample; leaving them on their own clocks would silently misalign them.

Resampling is NOT the same as interpolating across a dropout, and this source has many: the earbud
alone drops out 601 times for more than half a second. Those intervals are marked unobserved and any
labelled set overlapping one is dropped, rather than shipped as a straight line under a real
exercise label. See `MAX_GAP_SEC`.

`w{NN}_labels.csv` is `start_frame, end_frame, repetitions, exercise`, indexing the same video frame
counter as column 0 of every `.npy`, so label frames are mapped to wall-clock milliseconds through
that column. One labelled set becomes one session, which makes a *set* the unit of execution — sets
of the same exercise by the same subject are separated by minutes of other exercises, unlike the
within-bout repetitions of SPAR.
