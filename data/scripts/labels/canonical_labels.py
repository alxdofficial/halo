"""Unified activity-label vocabulary for every canonical training view.

When we harmonise, we also unify how activities are NAMED. Different training datasets describe the
same activity in different words — uci_har "laying" vs "lying"; pamap2 "ascending_stairs" vs
uci_har "walking_upstairs"; hapt "sit_to_stand" vs kuhar "standing_up_from_sitting". Canonical merge
maps each such raw label to ONE canonical name, so the harmonised corpus never describes the same
activity two ways.

Only GENUINE synonyms (and one spelling/scheme normalization) are merged — every distinct activity is
kept. In particular we deliberately DO NOT merge near-but-different activities: `jogging` ≠ `running`
(mhealth records both), each fall type stays separate, and wisdm's ambiguous `stairs` is kept as its
own label (it is neither specifically up nor down).

Scope: the harmonised **training** vocabulary only. Held-out eval datasets keep their native label
strings — they are the zero-shot targets. See docs/DATA_HETEROGENEITY.md.

`tests/test_canonical_labels.py` asserts every training label resolves, the map is idempotent, and no
canonical name is itself a merged-away synonym.
