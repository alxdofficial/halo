"""Global (canonical) training-label vocabulary for the closed-vocab ConSE baselines.

The ConSE baselines (CrossHAR, LiMU-BERT, ssl/harnet) and HALO's memory bank each key on ONE closed
vocabulary: the set of every training dataset's activities. We build it from the **canonical** labels
(`data.scripts.labels.canonical_labels`) so a synonym never occupies two output classes.

SOURCE OF TRUTH = THE GRIDS, NOT metadata.json.
Earlier versions read ``metadata.json["activities"]`` over a hardcoded 9-dataset list. That was wrong
twice over: the list was stale (it still contained `hapt` and predated sp_sw_har / nfi_fared / harmes /
xrf_v2), and **4 of the 12 current training datasets do not declare `activities` at all**. The result
was a 59-label vocabulary while the grids actually contain 93 canonical labels — so **11.5% of all
training windows (39,413 / 343,235) were silently dropped** as "out of vocabulary" by every consumer
(the memory bank, and every ConSE head-fit), concentrated in the fine-grained ADLs from the newer
datasets. Notably `elevator_up` / `elevator_down` existed in the corpus but were discarded, while
usc_had's elevator classes were being reported as ~0 F1.

Deriving from the grid labels cannot drift from what the models actually see. metadata.json is still
cross-checked and any disagreement is reported, but it is never the source.

Regenerate whenever the training datasets or their grids change — the vocabulary defines label
indices, so **every cached ConSE head and the memory bank must be rebuilt afterwards**. The adapters
compare their cached `labels` against this file and refit automatically on mismatch.
