"""Scan the built grids for BYTE-IDENTICAL repeated windows and cache their indices.

Two windows of real motion are never bit-for-bit equal. When they are, the source device
re-emitted a stale buffer instead of sampling. ExtraSensory's Pebble watch does this in long
runs: subject ``0A986513`` has one group of 178 identical recordings spanning 10,620 s, and
subject ``3600D531`` is 87.7% duplicates. NHANES does it too, but benignly — its repeats are
motionless non-wear blocks quantised to the same 0.001 g triple.

Two rules, because the two cases differ in what we can still trust:

* **All members share one label** -> exactly one of them is a genuine observation. Keep the
  first, drop the rest. The signal is real; only the repeats are fabricated.
* **Members disagree on the label** -> the buffer went stale across a label change, so the
  window is real but its label is unknowable. Drop the WHOLE group. Keeping an arbitrary
  member injects a known-wrong label at least half the time. On ExtraSensory's wrist stream
  this is 36.9% of duplicate pairs, dominated by lying<->sitting (4,413 pairs).

Duplicates are only ever matched WITHIN one stream. Simultaneous multi-placement streams
(xrf_v2, nfi_fared) are meant to describe the same event from different sensors.

Like ``scan_implausible``, results are cached to a small JSON so ``CorpusIndex`` stays lazy.
