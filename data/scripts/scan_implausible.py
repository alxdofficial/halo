"""Scan the built grids for PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE windows and cache their indices.

Some source releases contain windows beyond any consumer MEMS full-scale range. The widest ranges
shipped on phones/watches are +/-2000 dps (34.907 rad/s) and +/-16 g; a sample beyond either is not
vigorous motion, it is a scale/acquisition artifact. Training on it teaches the filterbank a band
energy that no real device can produce. BOTH modalities are screened, so accelerometer-only streams
(capture24, extrasensory, nhanes, unimib_shar) are covered — they used to be skipped entirely.

We DROP such windows rather than clip them — clipping fabricates a plausible value for data we know
is wrong. The scan is cached to a small JSON so ``CorpusIndex`` stays lazy (it must not read every
grid at construction time).

Run:  python -m data.scripts.scan_implausible
      python -m data.scripts.scan_implausible --alignment non_harmonised
