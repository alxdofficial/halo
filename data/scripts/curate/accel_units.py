"""Accelerometer UNIT canonicalization → g.

This module normalizes exactly ONE heterogeneity axis: the accelerometer UNIT, so that a still,
gravity-present window reads |acc| ≈ 1.0 g. (HALO's signed DC/gravity feature needs g — a per-channel
DC of 1.0 means "gravity", which is only true in g.) The gyroscope is NEVER touched.

Pipeline ordering (important — this is why the logic here is so small):

    raw session → deployment_policy.curate_*  →  accel_units.to_g  →  windowing  →  baseline_view

`deployment_policy` runs FIRST and owns GRAVITY: it selects the phone/watch device stream and, for the
iOS sets, reconstructs total acceleration = userAcceleration + gravity (both in g). So by the time a
stream reaches this module, gravity is already handled and each accelerometer is in its dataset's
NATIVE unit — all we do here is a scalar rescale (g stays; m/s² → ÷9.80665).

The per-dataset unit is a fixed property of how each dataset was recorded. The rationale for every
dataset is documented in `docs/DATA_HETEROGENEITY.md`; `tests/test_accel_units.py` asserts that every
dataset in the deployment policy is classified here exactly once, so a new dataset cannot be added
without a documented unit decision.
