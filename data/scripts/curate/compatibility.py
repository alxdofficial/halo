"""Acquisition compatibility for support-set construction (IMWUT `imwut/compare` line).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The comparison model is handed K labelled recordings alongside each query. Which recordings are
*allowed* to be handed over is a deployment consideration, not something the model should have to
learn: a pocket-phone query is not compared against smartwatch examples. This module is that
filter, and nothing here is claimed as a research contribution.

WHY IT IS NOT `applications/motion_monitoring/data/compatibility.py`
-------------------------------------------------------------------
That module keys off a live :class:`SensorStream` and normalises ``placement`` by lowercasing and
collapsing whitespace. The corpus stores ``StreamSpec.placement`` as free-text English, so that
normalisation leaves *six distinct keys for the wrist*::

    "the left wrist" · "left wrist" · "the wrist" · "wrist" · "dominant wrist" · "the right wrist"

Under exact-string matching the compatible pool fragments into near-singletons and cross-dataset
support becomes impossible, which breaks the core arm rather than only the experiment. This module
replaces the string with an explicit, checked-in **site** taken from a closed vocabulary.

TWO RELATIONS, NOT A LADDER
---------------------------
Per the design decision of 2026-09-03 the compatibility relation is binary:

* :func:`are_compatible` — identical key. This is what the core arm's sampler enforces.
* :func:`is_near_miss` — same device family, sites in the same equivalence group, key not
  identical. Left wrist against right wrist; a left trouser pocket against a back pocket. This is
  the only "further away" relation the experiment uses.

Anything outside those two (a wrist against an ankle, a watch against a phone) is **out of scope**.
We deliberately do not define a graded degradation ladder, because we do not claim one.

LATERALITY IS PRESERVED, PROSE IS NOT
-------------------------------------
``"the left wrist"`` and ``"left wrist"`` are the same site and collapse to one key. ``left_wrist``
and ``right_wrist`` stay distinct sites that are *equivalent* — so they are a near miss, never
identical. That is exactly the distinction the experiment needs: prose variation is noise, body
laterality is a real (if small) acquisition difference.

ALWAYS KEY OFF ``placement``, NEVER ``stream_id``
-------------------------------------------------
``nfi_fared``'s stream is called ``wrist`` but its curated placement is "the dominant forearm".
Every function here reads the spec, never the identifier.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- device families

#: ``StreamSpec.device_profile`` is already a coarse form factor. It is mapped explicitly rather
#: than pattern-matched so an unrecognised profile fails loudly.
#:
#: ``watch_proxy`` stays separate from ``watch``: shoaib straps a *phone* to the wrist, which has a
#: different mass and mounting rigidity from a watch. Merging them would assert an equivalence we
#: have not measured.
#:
#: ``device`` is the corpus's catch-all for body-worn research IMUs, and it also covers earbuds and
#: smart glasses. It is coarse on its own; the placement site is what separates an ear-worn unit
#: from a shin-mounted one.
