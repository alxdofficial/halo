"""``sensor_bias`` — activity-invariant channel physics, per sensor.

The third vector of the design of record (docs/design/DESIGN_OF_RECORD.md). Where
``text_descriptor`` says what the technician *declared* a sensor to be, ``sensor_bias`` says what the
signal *measurably* is. The two disagree more often than the field assumes — our own corpus audit
found recgym min-max normalised to [0,1], kuhar and uci_har shipping gravity-removed accelerometry,
and a g-vs-m/s^2 unit fingerprint leaking through the DC feature — and every one of those silently
corrupted cross-stream comparability.

WHY EVERY FIELD IS ACTIVITY-INVARIANT
-------------------------------------
The descriptor is pooled over *all* of a sensor's recordings. Datasets have skewed activity
distributions (a gym study's wrist sees mostly exercise; a free-living study's sees mostly
sedentary), so any field that responds to *what the person did* would make this vector a dataset
fingerprint, and retrieval conditioned on it would degenerate into "retrieve from the same dataset" —
a leakage trap of exactly the shape as hapt==uci_har. Every field below is therefore a property of
the acquisition CHANNEL, estimated on quiescent windows or from the signal's quantisation/range
structure, never from motion content.

``scan_fingerprint_risk`` is a monitor for dataset fingerprinting. Dataset and hardware are confounded
in the current corpus, so this offline check is explicitly inconclusive; the decisive checks are the
encoder dataset-ID probe and Phase-B retrieval-provenance analysis.

WHY EVERY FIELD IS A NORM OR AN AGGREGATE
-----------------------------------------
So that the SO(3) rotation augmentation leaves the descriptor unchanged. That is a design constraint,
not a coincidence: it is what lets the augmentation pushforward (``transform_bias``) stay exact.

Run:
    python -m data.scripts.curate.sensor_bias --build      # write per-sensor descriptors
    python -m data.scripts.curate.sensor_bias --check      # fingerprint-risk guard
