"""Print the corpus acquisition-key table and measure support-pool viability.

This is the artifact the user reviews by hand before the support sampler is trusted (handoff W1).
It answers three questions that decide whether the core arm is feasible at all:

1. Does every curated placement map to a site? (An unmapped one is a hard error.)
2. How large is the compatible pool for a typical training query — in streams, recordings and
   windows? The sampler needs K support rows drawn from recordings that are not the query's own
   and not its subject's, so a pool of one stream is a problem.
3. Does every evaluation stream have a compatible *training* partner? The zero-shot row draws its
   candidate-excluded support from the training corpus, so a key with no training partner leaves
   that row undefined. That is a finding to report, not something to paper over.
