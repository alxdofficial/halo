"""Sensor-level tokens — the (B,P,C,d) -> (B,P,S,d) fold, and the two conditioning projections.

DESIGN OF RECORD (docs/design/DESIGN_OF_RECORD.md). A **sensor** is one modality triad at one
placement (accel xyz, or gyro xyz); a 6-channel stream is two sensors. Three things change from the
per-channel encoder:

1. ``SensorFold`` folds a sensor's three axis tokens into ONE token. Sequence length drops 3x on
   6-channel streams, and role text ("x"/"y"/"z") becomes unnecessary — axis order is fixed inside
   the token, so position carries the axis identity that text used to.

2. ``ConditioningProjection`` gives ``text_descriptor`` and ``sensor_bias`` each a LEARNABLE MLP over
   a FROZEN artifact. That split is load-bearing: the projections adapt, the underlying SBERT vector
   and closed-form statistics do not. If the statistics themselves were learned they would stop
   being measurements, and the declared-vs-measured audit property would die with them.

3. ``DescriptorHead`` reconstructs a masked ``text_descriptor`` from the sensor's context. Scored
   RETRIEVALLY by the caller (is the true descriptor nearest among the batch's?) rather than by MSE,
   because regression to the corpus-mean text is a trivial solution when the corpus holds ~20
   distinct sensor descriptions.

WHY FOLDING NEEDS AN AXIS VALIDITY MASK
---------------------------------------
Per-channel tokens let ``channel_mask`` drop a dead axis outright. Once three axes share a token,
a dead axis (mhealth's degenerate gyro, or a channel-dropout event) would otherwise contribute its
raw value to the concatenation and silently poison the sensor. The fold therefore zeroes invalid
axes AND appends an explicit 3-dim validity indicator, so "this axis read zero" and "this axis is
absent" stay distinguishable — the same present-vs-unobservable distinction the Nyquist mask draws
in the frequency domain.
